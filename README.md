# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The purpose of the UFO analysis is to provide users more flexibility in terms of specifying their search criteria based on various new filters such as inputting city, state, country, and shape of the UFO, as opposed to just the date of the UFO sighting. 
## Results
In order for a user of the website to best utilize the functions of the website, along with the date, they can input information such as city, state, country, and shape of the UFO. With this information, the user can be presented with more specific and accurate information.

## Summary
As functional as this website now is, it does have one drawback which is that there is a lack of up-to-date information as a result of the data not being saved in a dataframe.
One recommendation I would give to help make this website more functional is to make the input not case-sensitive. This would allow the user to have the peace of mind of entering the correct inputs without any worry of perfect spelling. Another recommendation I would give is to expand the location barriers from just UFO sightings in the US to anywhere in the world.
